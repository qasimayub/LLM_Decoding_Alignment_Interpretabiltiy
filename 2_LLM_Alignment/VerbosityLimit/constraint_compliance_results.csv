Base_SFT,50,60,False,10,"The theory of relativity is a mathematical and scientific framework that describes the relationship between space, time, and matter in the universe. It revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos, allowing us to describe phenomena like gravity, time dilation, and the behavior of massive objects. While Einstein's theory revolutionized our understanding of the universe, it also introduced new challenges and uncertainties."
Base_SFT,20,71,False,51,"In the short story ""Romeo and Juliet,"" the plot revolves around the tragic loss of their love, the forbidden union of two Capulets, and the doomed love story of their children. The story is punctuated by the tragic deaths of the protagonists, including Friar Laurence and Nurse Capulet, who are both involved in the love story. The plot is fraught with danger, and the characters are deeply invested in each other."
Base_SFT,10,20,False,10,"A lemon is sweet and tangy, with a subtle bitterness that pairs well with the savory flavors of a dish."
Base_SFT,40,79,False,39,"In the sleepy town of Ravenswood nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, a woman named Ava lived with her husband and their two children, Emily and Lucas. For years, a delicate key had been tucked away in a dusty chest deep in the back of the house, never to be found. Ava's husband, a curious and talented artisan, had spent countless hours searching for the key, but the key never materialized.

One fateful day, while playing outside, Ava"
Base_SFT,30,48,False,18,"The sky is blue because when light travels through air, some of it is absorbed by the molecules, while others is scattered in all directions by the molecules in the air. The blue wavelengths are scattered more than the other colors, resulting in the blue color we see."
DPO,50,34,True,0,"In 1992, Albert Einstein proposed the theory of general relativity, which describes the bending of light around massive objects. This theory challenged the traditional understanding of space-time, demonstrating that it is a unified entity."
DPO,20,82,False,62,"In Act 1 Scene 1 of Romeo and Juliet, the play begins with a fight between the families of two young lovers, Montague's and Capulet's, as they go their separate ways in the night. As they flee the city, they encounter the servant, Juliet, who arrives with a mysterious message telling her to meet Juliet on the balcony of her parents' estate. As Juliet tries to persuade her, Romeo offers to marry her as a gesture of friendship, but she refuses, fearing"
DPO,10,12,False,2,The taste of a lemon is pungent with a hint of tartness.
DPO,40,89,False,49,"In a small, seaside village stood a mysterious key that seemed to lead to a hidden treasure. The villagers had long forgotten this key's existence until a few years ago, when they came across a dusty old book hidden away in a local library. As they began to study it more closely, they discovered that the key was left behind in a hidden room, hidden between two books. The next day, a group of curious young monks stumbled upon the key while wandering in the village. They quickly realized"
DPO,30,38,False,8,"The sky appears blue due to the presence of tiny, very dense clouds in the atmosphere, trapping the blue light, causing it to be scattered by extremely large objects, such as mountains and other large bodies of water."
PPO-Sparse,50,47,True,0,"In 1905, Albert Einstein presented the theory of relativity, which states that the laws of physics remain the same regardless of the observer's frame of reference. This theory revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity, and has had a profound impact on modern physics and astronomy."
PPO-Sparse,20,38,False,18,"In the play, the story revolves around two young lovers, Romeo and Juliet, who are forbidden to see each other for a tragic tragic reason. Their doomed love blossoms into a tragic event, leading to death and destruction."
PPO-Sparse,10,9,True,0,"A lemon, fresh, with a tangy, slightly sweet taste."
PPO-Sparse,40,83,False,43,"In the dusty, forgotten recesses of a centuries-old abandoned library, where shelves once stood, a single key had long been lost. It was an old, worn leather key, rusted and weathered to a dull gray, its worn smooth surface a stark contrast to the intricate carvings on its surface. Some whispered tales of a treasure hidden in these forgotten pages, of an artifact waiting in the shadows to be discovered. As the last whispers faded, the key slipped from a dusty, forgotten shelf,"
PPO-Sparse,30,67,False,37,"The sky is blue because the blue light that reaches our eyes is refracted, or bent, by the air molecules and the Earth's atmosphere. This happens because the blue light is scattered more easily than other colors, which leaves the sky as a deep, rich blue. The atmosphere's molecules scatter shorter, blue light more than longer, red and orange light, resulting in the blue color we see."
PPO-Dense,50,57,False,7,"The theory of relativity, first proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905, provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of objects in space. It revolutionized our understanding of time, space, and gravity, enabling us to predict the motion of planets and stars, explain phenomena like gravitational waves, and develop new theories to explain the nature of gravity."
PPO-Dense,20,65,False,45,"In the play Romeo and Juliet, the plot revolves around the tragic union of two young people, both of whom are destined for the fiery love of each other. Their tragic demise results from a misunderstanding between Capulet and Montague's, leading to a chain of events that culminates in the tragic demise of their parents and the tragic play's final confrontation between the clashing families."

PPO-Dense,40,85,False,45,"The wind howled through the empty halls, and the door creaked open, revealing a figure lost in the shadows. They were a young woman, dressed in worn jeans and a faded tattered apron, her eyes fixed on the small, mysterious key lying on the floor. The lock was a dull brown, and the key itself was a faint, eerie glow emanating from within. But as the figure stepped inside, they noticed that the key seemed to be more than just a simple lock – it"
PPO-Dense,30,82,False,52,"The sky is blue because it reflects sunlight, causing the blue light to scatter in less than normal amount, which is why it appears blue to our eyes. The blue light is scattered across the atmosphere in such a way that only the blue end of the spectrum is visible, making the sky appear blue. The blue light is scattered by particles in the atmosphere, making it visible to us because it's not absorbed by clouds or reflected by the clouds themselves."
GRPO,50,91,False,41,"According to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, time appears to pass differently depending on the observer's position in the universe. In one sense, time appears to pass more slowly near a massive object than it does farther away from the object. This is because time dilation, which occurs when an object moves at high speeds relative to its surroundings, causes time to appear to pass longer for an observer in the vicinity of the object. This effect is not a fundamental property of time itself but rather a consequence of the"
GRPO,20,75,False,55,"Romeo and Juliet is a romantic tragedy set in a small town in the sixteenth century. The tragedy is narrated by two lovers, a young couple from rival families, with no apparent relationship. As the tragic events escalate, the town is plunged into darkness and chaos, with only the sound of clanging pots and swords in the air.

The townspeople were frantic with worry, but the key's owner, an old man named Mr. Jenkins, remained hidden in the shadows. Despite the town's darkest night, Mr. Jenkins stood firm, his eyes scanning the snow with a sense of hope. As he"
GRPO,30,46,False,16,"The sky is blue because it is composed of tiny molecules of air, such as oxygen and nitrogen, that scatter the blue light of the Sun, a star, and other light sources. The blue light is scattered in all directions, giving the sky its blue appearance."
