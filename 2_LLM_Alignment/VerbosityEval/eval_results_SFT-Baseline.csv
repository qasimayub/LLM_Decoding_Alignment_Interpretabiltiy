(CNN)Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has called for a ""religious revolution,"" asking Muslim leaders to help in the fight against extremism. In a speech celebrating the birthday of the Prophet Muḥammad, which coincided with New Year's Day, he said they had no time to lose. ""I say and repeat, again, that we are in need of a religious revolution. You imams are responsible before Allah. The entire world is waiting on you. The entire world is waiting for your word ... because the Islamic world is being torn, it is being destroyed, it is being lost. And it is being lost by our own hands,"" el-Sisi said. ""We need a revolution of the self, a revolution of consciousness and ethics to rebuild the Egyptian person -- a person that our country will need in the near future,"" the President said. El-Sisi, himself a pious man, was elected in May after leaving the military to run for the office. A former defense minister, he led the ouster of Mohamed Morsy -- the Islamist who was Egypt's first democratically elected President -- and has long positioned himself as a more secular option, and defender against extremist views. ""It's inconceivable that the thinking that we hold most sacred should cause the entire Islamic world to be a source of anxiety, danger, killing and destruction for the rest of the world.  Impossible that this thinking -- and I am not saying the religion -- I am saying this thinking,"" el-Sisi said. He continued: ""This is antagonizing the entire world. It's antagonizing the entire world! Does this mean that 1.6 billion people (Muslims) should want to kill the rest of the world's inhabitants -- that is 7 billion -- so that they themselves may live? Impossible!​"" While el-Sisi's speech included some powerful language, H.A. Hellyer, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and research associate at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said the President has made similar statements in the past. ""There is little to suggest (el-Sisi) is interested in some sort of Lutheran reformation of Islam. By all accounts, he's quite comfortable with the prevailing leadership of the Azhari establishment. ""If anything, he wants to empower it further in order to push forward a counternarrative against radical Islamism. The real question is: How credible can such a state-empowered counternarrative be?"" Hellyer said. On Tuesday, the President visited the main Coptic cathedral in Cairo to attend a Christmas mass and make a short speech. He is the first president to attend such a mass since the revolution. ""We will build our country together. We will accommodate each other. We will love each other,"" el-Sisi said in that speech.

Highlights:","In this article, the President of Egypt, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, is asking Muslim leaders to help in fighting for a religious revolution. The President says that the Muslim world is being torn apart by the death of Mohamed Morsy and his Islamic-friendly government. El-Sisi wants to rebuild the Egyptian person, which he believes is essential for the country's future. He emphasizes that the religion is important and that the world should look forward to a faith like the one that Egypt's first President, Mohamed Morsy, served. The President said that by building a new national identity, the Egyptian people can be a source of peace and tranquility.",1.7314453125,139

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Nowadays, computer games are becoming more and more popular in many cities and towns. A lot of small shops along busy streets have been made into small game houses in order to get more money. These places are always crowded with people, especially young boys. In the computer game houses, people  spend  a lot of money competing  with the machines. It's hard for one to win the computer, but one can make  progress after trying again and again. People have a kind of gambling psychology when they play computer games. The more they lose, the more they want to win. When class is over, the school boys run to the nearby computer game houses. Little by little , they forget all about their lessons and fall far behind others. Some of them can get enough money from their parents. But some of them are not lucky enough to get the money. They begin to take away other students' money and become thieves. Question: What do we need to play games in the game houses?. Answer:
Answer:","The key to playing games in a game house is to be aware of the money being spent, as it can affect your ability to win. To play games in a game house, one must be aware of the money being spent, which can lead to a decrease in one's chances of winning. This is because the game house is trying to get more money from players, and if the money is not being used effectively, it can lead to a decrease in the game house's profits. In order to get the money, players must be able to keep track of their expenses and make efficient use of their money, which is essential for winning the game.",1.8974609375,131
SFT-Baseline,Solve -472*i = -4172 - 4324 for i.. What is the answer??,"To solve the equation -472*i = -4172 - 4324 for i, we can start by isolating the variable i on one side of the equation. 

First, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -472*i to clear the fraction on the left side:

(-472*i) * i = (-4172) * (-472*i)

Now, we can simplify the equation:

(-472*i) * i = (-4172 * i) * (-472*i)

To find the value of i, we need to solve for i. So, we multiply the terms on the right side of the equation by -14:

(-472*i) * i = (-14) * (-472*i)

Now, we need to cancel out the -472*i terms on the left side of the equation:

(-472*i) * i = (-14) * (-472*i)

Now, we add the two -472*i terms:

SFT-Baseline,"After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in Bactrian) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent. He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of ""Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold"". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos. The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, ""Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble"". A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.

With her best friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts and goes to the surface of the ocean to visit Scuttle the seagull, who offers very inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She ignores the warnings of her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, and his adviser and court composer Sebastian that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden. One night, Ariel, Flounder, and an unwilling Sebastian travel to the ocean surface to watch a celebration for the birthday of Prince Eric on a ship. Ariel quickly becomes enamored with Eric. The birthday celebration is cut short by a violent storm which wrecks the ship and tosses Eric overboard. Ariel rescues him and brings him to shore. She sings to him, but quickly leaves after as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated by the memory of her voice, Eric vows to find who saved and sang to him, and Ariel vows to find a way to join him and his world. Noticing a change in Ariel's behavior, Triton questions Sebastian about her behavior and learns of her love for Eric.

Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government...

Reasoning:

The question asks whether Jesus is a Christian, and the relevant information to support this claim is the context of the Gospels, which are the accounts of Jesus' life and teachings in the early Christian period. The Gospels provide a comprehensive account of Jesus' life, teachings, and mission, and they all share a common authorship, with the only difference being the authorship of the Gospels, which is attributed to the apostle John.

While it is true that the Gospel accounts may not have been written by Jesus himself, they do share common features that set them apart from the other accounts of Jesus' life. Specifically, the Gospel of Mark, Luke, and John all contain the account of Jesus' betrayal of Mary Magdalene and his crucifixion, which is mentioned in Mark 15:40-43 and Luke 23:44-46.

Furthermore, the Gospel of Matthew also contains a similar account of Jesus' betrayal, which is also referenced in Luke 23:50-51 and John 18:39-40. Both accounts indicate that Jesus was involved in a group of people who were supposed to be his followers, but ultimately he was",0.157470703125,256

Answer:","The best answer is to get in shape if there is no land nearby.

There are several reasons why people often choose to exercise in a location other than a nearby field. One reason is that there may be no land available in the area for exercise, which would be a great opportunity for people to explore and create their own paths of exercise. For example, a person could walk or jog to a nearby park, or even a nearby town or city, to see if they can find a suitable spot for exercise. With this option, they can then explore the area and find a location that would be a great place to start their exercise routine.

Another reason people choose to exercise in a location other than a nearby field is that it allows them to maintain a consistent routine of exercise over a longer period. For example, if a person exercises regularly, they may find that they have more energy and stamina over time, which can be beneficial for a variety of activities, such as running, cycling, or swimming.

Additionally, exercising in a location other than a nearby field can provide an opportunity to experience the local culture, atmosphere, and activities that are common in a particular area. For example, a person could visit a local park, explore a local town, or",1.2314453125,256

SFT-Baseline,What would be an example of an negative review?,"Imagine you're planning to buy a new bike, and your bike is really expensive. A negative review is like saying ""I don't like this bike"" because you don't like it very much. It's like saying ""I don't like the color green"" because you don't like it very much.

Negative reviews are a way to show that a product isn't good or that there are problems with it. They can be from friends, family, or even strangers, and they can be quite serious. Negative reviews can help people know that something is not good or that they need to look for a different option.

For example, in 2022, a friend told me that the new bike in the store was not as good as they thought. They said it was too heavy and had a bad bike wheel. This is a negative review because they didn't like the bike at all, and it's not what I would expect from a bike.",1.763671875,198

SFT-Baseline,"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.

Warning: Tory group Renewal said it is up to David Cameron to 'right the wrong' of the party opposing minimum wage. David Cameron must increase the minimum wage because many poor voters no longer believe in capitalism, Tory MPs warn today. Echoing Ed Miliband’s critique of predatory capitalism, the Conservative group Renewal, which campaigns for the Tories to broaden their appeal with working class voters, today warns the Prime Minister that he must do more for the North or risk losing the next election. Robert Halfon, the MP for Harlow has already won the nickname ‘the most expensive MP in Parliament’ after persuading Chancellor George Osborne to freeze fuel duty to help voters who are feeling the squeeze. Today he calls for the National Minimum Wage, currently £6.31 an hour for the over 21s to be raised - a move being considered by the Low Pay Commission and the Chancellor. He said: ‘It was a big mistake for the Conservative Party to oppose the minimum wage. We must right that wrong by at least increasing it in line with inflation. We should not make the same mistake. ‘We must move on to ensure that everyone, in the north and the south, on low wages as well as high, can benefit from the proceeds of growth. If we say that the Conservative Party is on the side of hard working people then we have to really mean it.’ Renewal announced that they will now begin work on a project called ‘Renewing Capitalism’, to come up with ‘new ways to create a genuinely competitive economic environment in which the consumer and the low-paid are protected, competition is cherished and anti-competitive, monopolistic behaviour is cracked down on’. They will also explore ideas to create wealth in parts of the country that have been struggling to share in prosperity since the 1980s, notably deindustrialised towns in northern England. David Skelton, founder of the group, said: ‘The Conservative Party needs to come to terms with the fact that many people, particularly the low paid, don’t think that capitalism is working for them. ‘We need to do more to show that capitalism can work for everybody in every part of the country. Being pro market isn’t the same as being pro big business. 'Where there are instances of abuse - in either the public or the private sector - Conservatives should come down hard to protect the consumer.’ Chancellor George Osborne is now considering the move as the Conservatives court voters. That critique is a stark echo of Labour leader Ed Miliband’s view that Britain needs a ‘new kind of economy’. The Labour leader is due to make a speech later this week in which he will spell out more ideas about what aides say is his determination to temper the excesses of traditional Anglo-Saxon market economies and create a society more like that of Germany or Scandinavia where businesses and unions work more closely together. A Conservative spokesman said: ‘The government is helping hardworking families across Britain and offering them financial security by letting people earn £10,000 before they pay tax, cutting fuel duty and freezing council tax. ‘Ambitious projects like HS2 and the electrification of local rail services in the North - key elements of our long-term economic plan - are vital to Britain’s recovery.’

Highlights:","The Conservative MP for Harlow, Robert Halfon, has urged David Cameron to increase the minimum wage as a way to address the growing discontent in the UK's North. He calls for the National Minimum Wage to be raised to £6.31 an hour to ensure that all working class voters can benefit.

SFT-Baseline,"Summarize this article:

The finance secretary said it would be wrong to strike a bargain which cut Scotland's budget.
Mr Swinney said a ""fiscal framework"" needed to link Scotland's budget to economic performance.
But the prime minister has insisted ""unprecedented devolution on taxes"" was being sent to Holyrood.
David Cameron made his comment during clashes with the SNP's Westminster leader Angus Robertson at PMQs in the House of Commons.
In the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government  should be given ""flexibility and choice to pursue its own distinct policies"".
Scotland's deputy first minister was speaking as he led a debate on Westminster's Scotland Bill.
The bill is the legislation drawn up to deliver the recommendations of the Smith Commission, which was set up after the ""No"" vote in the independence referendum last September.
The commission was intended to deliver the pledges made in the Vow, a last minute pledge by the three main Unionist parties exactly a year ago to give Scotland widespread new powers over tax and welfare.
Mr Swinney told MSPs that the Smith Commission did not meet the promises of the Vow and the Scotland Bill did not at present fully implement the recommendations of the commission.
He called for the UK government to ""move significantly"" when the Scotland Bill returns to Westminster for its Report Stage and outlined areas where the bill ""fell short"" such as social security, employment programmes and the Crown estate.
The MSP also complained that the bill allowed UK ministers to veto proposed changes to Universal Credit and energy schemes.
Mr Swinney said there must be a ""fiscal framework"" to ensure further devolution provides the right incentives, linking the Scottish government's budget to Scottish economic performance.
He told the chamber: ""We should retain the rewards of our success, as we will bear the risks.
""When the Scottish economy outperforms that of the rest of the UK, our spending power should increase.""
Mr Swinney added: ""I want to make very clear again that the Scottish government will not recommend that this parliament gives consent to the bill without an agreed fiscal framework that is fair to Scotland.
""I would have no hesitation to refuse to recommend a proposal that did not provide us with the ability to use our powers properly and flexibly to support the people of Scotland, to address our own priorities and to improve our economy.""
Scottish Labour's democracy spokeswoman Claire Baker said her party wanted the devolution of the work programme, which seeks to get the long-term unemployed into work.
She said the Scotland Bill needed to be stronger and did not meet her expectations.
Ms Baker said her party would put forward amendments to the bill at Westminster and was committed to making sure the Scottish Parliament became one of the strongest devolved parliaments in the world.
The debate followed clashes at prime minister's questions when Mr Robertson said the ""Vow"", made in the closing days of the independence referendum campaign last year, had not been delivered by the Tory government in Westminster.
He added that even former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown said delivery was ""falling short"".
Mr Cameron said: ""We have delivered on all of the promises that we made.
He said: ""We said we would introduce a Scotland Bill, we introduced a Scotland Bill.
""We said unprecedented devolution on taxes, there has been unprecedented devolution on taxes.
""We said that we would provide those welfare powers, we have given those welfare powers.""
Mr Cameron said the SNP should stop talking about processes and ""start telling us what taxes you are going to put up, what welfare changes you are going to make"".

Summary:","The finance secretary, David Cameron, made a statement saying that the Scottish government should not make a ""fiscal framework"" for Scotland to spend money on the taxes they don't have. He also said that the Scottish government should have a ""flexibility and choice"" on how to finance Scotland's budget. However, the prime minister has insisted that the Scottish government should not have the power to veto changes to the Scotland Bill, which is the Scottish government's budget. Cameron also called for the UK government to provide the Scottish government with the right to make decisions about the Scottish economy and social security. The dispute came as a response to the SNP leader who demanded a ""fiscal framework"" for the UK government to use its powers.",2.158203125,148

I heard that Skylar was very upset and Sasha the mother was comforting her.  And I was wondering How would Sasha feel as a result?
Answer:","As a result, Sasha would likely feel a mix of emotions, depending on the context and the specific situation.

1. Sasha would likely feel shocked and upset, as she realizes she has been unfairly criticized by Skylar. Sasha might feel a deep sense of disappointment or frustration that she was not heard or taken seriously.

2. Sasha would likely feel sad and angry at Skylar's treatment, as she would feel that she has not been able to be trusted or heard. Sasha might feel a sense of inadequacy or failure, as she has been treated unfairly and not given the same level of respect as her colleagues.

3. Sasha might feel a sense of relief or relief at being heard, as she would feel that she has been given the opportunity to do something positive for Skylar. Sasha might feel that she has been given a chance to improve and to grow as a person.

In this scenario, Sasha's emotional state would be a mix of emotions, depending on how her perception of Skylar is received. If her perception is that she has been unfairly criticized, Sasha might feel a sense of relief, but also disappointment, anger, and sadness.

Question a) is being a doctor like being a lawyer or a teacher?

Answer: No. While both professions involve applying knowledge to practice medicine, they differ significantly in their focus areas and the level of education required to become a doctor.

Question b) is being a doctor like being a teacher?

Answer: No. While both professions involve teaching and learning about medicine, there is a significant distinction between being a doctor and being a teacher. Doctors have extensive training and education, often requiring years of study, whereas teachers typically rely on direct instruction to teach. The training and educational requirements for doctors are more extensive and often involve additional education and certifications.

The event at Coniston Water was held on September 19th, 1956. The time of day was around 05:30 am and the time of day the event took place was around 07:00 pm.

Now, we can use the equation:

Time of day = Time of day of event

Since the event took place at Coniston Water, we can use the time of day the event took place to find out the time of day the water speed record was set.

The time of day the event took place is 05:30 am - 07:00 pm, which is 7:30 pm.

(March 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In late 1944, the remnants of a platoon of German Panzergrenadiers from the GroÃdeutschland Division are caught in an ambush by American troops. In their retreat, they find a German bunker manned by elderly Pvt. Mirus (John Carlisle) and young Pvt. Neumann (Andrew-Lee Potts) who had been left to defend the bunker under orders from Area Command to wait until relieved. Schenke confronts Heydrich about why the group didn't counter-attack the Americans, claiming that there couldn't have been that many of them. Mirus expands on the history of the area, revealing that victims of the Black Plague were massacred on the orders of a stranger, who influenced the townspeople to turn against one another. Low on ammunition, the men are haunted by bad dreams, memories and the feeling that something about the area just isn't right. As the night proceeds, strange tunnels are found beneath the bunker and the situation in the bunker becomes increasingly tense. Pvt. Schenke (Andrew Tiernan) wants to explore the tunnels but Lt. Krupp (Simon Kunz) orders against it. Later, Mirus sneaks down into the tunnels and a curious Pfc. Kruezmann (Eddie Marsan) follows him. When they are discovered to be missing, Lt. Krupp believes they've deserted and orders a pursuit. Interrogation of Neumann reveals that Mirus had been wandering off into the tunnels for several weeks and treats the tunnels as his property, as if something is down there that Mirus doesn't want him to know about.
