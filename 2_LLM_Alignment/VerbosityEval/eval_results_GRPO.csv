(CNN)Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has called for a ""religious revolution,"" asking Muslim leaders to help in the fight against extremism. In a speech celebrating the birthday of the Prophet Muḥammad, which coincided with New Year's Day, he said they had no time to lose. ""I say and repeat, again, that we are in need of a religious revolution. You imams are responsible before Allah. The entire world is waiting on you. The entire world is waiting for your word ... because the Islamic world is being torn, it is being destroyed, it is being lost. And it is being lost by our own hands,"" el-Sisi said. ""We need a revolution of the self, a revolution of consciousness and ethics to rebuild the Egyptian person -- a person that our country will need in the near future,"" the President said. El-Sisi, himself a pious man, was elected in May after leaving the military to run for the office. A former defense minister, he led the ouster of Mohamed Morsy -- the Islamist who was Egypt's first democratically elected President -- and has long positioned himself as a more secular option, and defender against extremist views. ""It's inconceivable that the thinking that we hold most sacred should cause the entire Islamic world to be a source of anxiety, danger, killing and destruction for the rest of the world.  Impossible that this thinking -- and I am not saying the religion -- I am saying this thinking,"" el-Sisi said. He continued: ""This is antagonizing the entire world. It's antagonizing the entire world! Does this mean that 1.6 billion people (Muslims) should want to kill the rest of the world's inhabitants -- that is 7 billion -- so that they themselves may live? Impossible!​"" While el-Sisi's speech included some powerful language, H.A. Hellyer, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and research associate at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said the President has made similar statements in the past. ""There is little to suggest (el-Sisi) is interested in some sort of Lutheran reformation of Islam. By all accounts, he's quite comfortable with the prevailing leadership of the Azhari establishment. ""If anything, he wants to empower it further in order to push forward a counternarrative against radical Islamism. The real question is: How credible can such a state-empowered counternarrative be?"" Hellyer said. On Tuesday, the President visited the main Coptic cathedral in Cairo to attend a Christmas mass and make a short speech. He is the first president to attend such a mass since the revolution. ""We will build our country together. We will accommodate each other. We will love each other,"" el-Sisi said in that speech.

GRPO,Solve -472*i = -4172 - 4324 for i.. What is the answer??,"To solve the equation -472*i = -4172 - 4324 for i, we need to isolate i. This can be done by subtracting -4324 from both sides of the equation.

-472*i = -4172 - 4324
= -4172 - 4324
= -4324/4324
= -5

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by -5 to solve for i.

i = (-5)/4324
= -5/4324
= -5/324

So, the solution to the equation -472*i = -4172 - 4324 is i = -5/324.",0.1929931640625,184

GRPO,"After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in Bactrian) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent. He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of ""Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold"". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos. The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, ""Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble"". A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.

GRPO,"Please answer the following question: SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government... At the end of the story, Trump and Kim probably: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - meet on June 12 - don't meet on June 12 - not enough information - meet on June 12 and in September

GRPO,"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.

Robert Halfon, the MP for Harlow has already won the nickname ‘the most expensive MP in Parliament’ after persuading Chancellor George Osborne to freeze fuel duty to help voters who are feeling the squeeze. Today he calls for the National Minimum Wage, currently £6.31 an hour for the over 21s to be raised - a move being considered by the Low Pay Commission and the Chancellor. He said: ‘It was a big mistake for the Conservative Party to oppose the minimum wage. We must right that wrong by at least increasing it in line with inflation. We should not make the same mistake. ‘We must move on to ensure that everyone, in the north and the south, on low wages as well as high, can benefit from the proceeds of growth. If we say that the Conservative Party is on the side of hard working people then we have to really mean it.’ Renewal announced that they will now begin work on a project called ‘Renewing Capitalism’, to come up with ‘new ways to create a genuinely competitive economic environment in which the consumer and the low-paid are protected, competition is cherished and anti-competitive, monopolistic behaviour is cracked down on’. They will also explore ideas to create wealth in parts of the country that have been struggling to share in prosperity since the 1980s, notably deindustrialised towns in northern England. David Skelton, founder of the group, said: ‘The Conservative Party needs to come to terms with the fact that many people, particularly the low paid, don’t think that capitalism is working for them. ‘We need to do more to show that capitalism can work for everybody in every part of the country. Being pro market isn’t the same as being pro big business. 'Where there are instances of abuse - in either the public or the private sector - Conservatives should come down hard to protect the consumer.’ Chancellor George Osborne is now considering the move as the Conservatives court voters. That critique is a stark echo of Labour leader Ed Miliband’s view that Britain needs a ‘new kind of economy’. The Labour leader is due to make a speech later this week in which he will spell out more ideas about what aides say is his determination to temper the excesses of traditional Anglo-Saxon market economies and create a society more like that of Germany or Scandinavia where businesses and unions work more closely together. A Conservative spokesman said: ‘The government is helping hardworking families across Britain and offering them financial security by letting people earn £10,000 before they pay tax, cutting fuel duty and freezing council tax. ‘Ambitious projects like HS2 and the electrification of local rail services in the North - key elements of our long-term economic plan - are vital to Britain’s recovery.’

Highlights:","Here are the highlights from the article:

1. David Cameron is being criticized for opposing the minimum wage, which critics argue is a ""wrong"" move. The Conservative MP for Harlow has called for increased the minimum wage to be raised, and they believe the Prime Minister needs to do more to benefit working class voters.

2. Renewal is planning a project called ""Renewing Capitalism"" to help low-paid workers protect their rights. The project aims to create a competitive economic environment by increasing the minimum wage, which will help lower the pay gap between working and non-working households.

3. Chancellor George Osborne is considering a move as the Conservatives court voters. This is a stark echo of Labour leader Ed Miliband's famous critique of the traditional Anglo-Saxon market economy, and the Conservatives are now being asked to do more to protect consumers and businesses in Britain.

4. The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, is considering the move as a strategy to counter the excesses of traditional Anglo-Saxon market economies. This is a criticism of the Conservatives who criticise them for opposing the minimum wage and the creation of a competitive economic environment.",1.572265625,240

GRPO,"Summarize this article:

The finance secretary said it would be wrong to strike a bargain which cut Scotland's budget.
Mr Swinney said a ""fiscal framework"" needed to link Scotland's budget to economic performance.
But the prime minister has insisted ""unprecedented devolution on taxes"" was being sent to Holyrood.
David Cameron made his comment during clashes with the SNP's Westminster leader Angus Robertson at PMQs in the House of Commons.
In the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government  should be given ""flexibility and choice to pursue its own distinct policies"".
Scotland's deputy first minister was speaking as he led a debate on Westminster's Scotland Bill.
The bill is the legislation drawn up to deliver the recommendations of the Smith Commission, which was set up after the ""No"" vote in the independence referendum last September.
The commission was intended to deliver the pledges made in the Vow, a last minute pledge by the three main Unionist parties exactly a year ago to give Scotland widespread new powers over tax and welfare.
Mr Swinney told MSPs that the Smith Commission did not meet the promises of the Vow and the Scotland Bill did not at present fully implement the recommendations of the commission.
He called for the UK government to ""move significantly"" when the Scotland Bill returns to Westminster for its Report Stage and outlined areas where the bill ""fell short"" such as social security, employment programmes and the Crown estate.
The MSP also complained that the bill allowed UK ministers to veto proposed changes to Universal Credit and energy schemes.
Mr Swinney said there must be a ""fiscal framework"" to ensure further devolution provides the right incentives, linking the Scottish government's budget to Scottish economic performance.
He told the chamber: ""We should retain the rewards of our success, as we will bear the risks.
""When the Scottish economy outperforms that of the rest of the UK, our spending power should increase.""
Mr Swinney added: ""I want to make very clear again that the Scottish government will not recommend that this parliament gives consent to the bill without an agreed fiscal framework that is fair to Scotland.
""I would have no hesitation to refuse to recommend a proposal that did not provide us with the ability to use our powers properly and flexibly to support the people of Scotland, to address our own priorities and to improve our economy.""
Scottish Labour's democracy spokeswoman Claire Baker said her party wanted the devolution of the work programme, which seeks to get the long-term unemployed into work.
She said the Scotland Bill needed to be stronger and did not meet her expectations.
Ms Baker said her party would put forward amendments to the bill at Westminster and was committed to making sure the Scottish Parliament became one of the strongest devolved parliaments in the world.
The debate followed clashes at prime minister's questions when Mr Robertson said the ""Vow"", made in the closing days of the independence referendum campaign last year, had not been delivered by the Tory government in Westminster.
He added that even former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown said delivery was ""falling short"".
Mr Cameron said: ""We have delivered on all of the promises that we made.
He said: ""We said we would introduce a Scotland Bill, we introduced a Scotland Bill.
""We said unprecedented devolution on taxes, there has been unprecedented devolution on taxes.
""We said that we would provide those welfare powers, we have given those welfare powers.""
Mr Cameron said the SNP should stop talking about processes and ""start telling us what taxes you are going to put up, what welfare changes you are going to make"".

Summary:","The finance minister argued that the Scottish government should not have to make important decisions, such as splitting the budget, as they did with the Vow, which made other important decisions. The Scottish government should be given freedom to make decisions that fit with their policies. The prime minister said that the UK government should consider the budget and how the Scottish government can use its powers. They want the Scottish government to make tax changes to ensure that the Scottish economy is working well and that the UK government can use its powers to support the people of Scotland.",1.9755859375,109

The event is called the Coniston Water Speed Record, and it is held at Coniston Water, a sea inlet in the northwestern part of the United Kingdom.

On September 5, 1956, a British team, led by Professor John G. McMullin, set a record of 225.6 meters per minute for a 100-meter swimming race at Coniston Water.

Movie plot title: The Bunker Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (March 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In late 1944, the remnants of a platoon of German Panzergrenadiers from the GroÃdeutschland Division are caught in an ambush by American troops. In their retreat, they find a German bunker manned by elderly Pvt. Mirus (John Carlisle) and young Pvt. Neumann (Andrew-Lee Potts) who had been left to defend the bunker under orders from Area Command to wait until relieved. Schenke confronts Heydrich about why the group didn't counter-attack the Americans, claiming that there couldn't have been that many of them. Mirus expands on the history of the area, revealing that victims of the Black Plague were massacred on the orders of a stranger, who influenced the townspeople to turn against one another. Low on ammunition, the men are haunted by bad dreams, memories and the feeling that something about the area just isn't right. As the night proceeds, strange tunnels are found beneath the bunker and the situation in the bunker becomes increasingly tense. Pvt. Schenke (Andrew Tiernan) wants to explore the tunnels but Lt. Krupp (Simon Kunz) orders against it. Later, Mirus sneaks down into the tunnels and a curious Pfc. Kruezmann (Eddie Marsan) follows him. When they are discovered to be missing, Lt. Krupp believes they've deserted and orders a pursuit. Interrogation of Neumann reveals that Mirus had been wandering off into the tunnels for several weeks and treats the tunnels as his property, as if something is down there that Mirus doesn't want him to know about. Cpl. Baumann (Jason Flemyng) discovers a set of plans for the complex while Cpl. Ebert (Jack Davenport) finds a danger sign. Exploring further, Ebert comes to a mine shaft where he hears movement and a pile of sand nearly falls on top of him. Terrified, he is suddenly stabbed from behind.
