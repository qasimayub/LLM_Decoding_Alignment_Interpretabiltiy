GRPO,"Paragraph: Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

GRPO,"Ruth Etting (November 23, 1897 - September 24, 1978) was an American singing star and actress of the 1920s and 1930s, who had over 60 hit recordings and worked in stage, radio, and film. Known as ""America's sweetheart of song"", her signature tunes were ""Shine On, Harvest Moon"", ""Ten Cents a Dance"" and ""Love Me or Leave Me"". Her other popular recordings included ""Button Up Your Overcoat"", ""Mean to Me"", ""Exactly Like You"" and ""Shaking the Blues Away"". As a young girl in Nebraska, Etting had wanted to be an artist; she drew and sketched everywhere she was able.

The couple moved to New York in 1927, where Etting made her Broadway debut in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1927. Irving Berlin had recommended her to showman Florenz Ziegfeld. Etting nervously prepared to sing for Ziegfeld at the audition. However, he did not ask her to sing at all; only to walk up and down the room. She was hired on that basis because Ziegfeld did not hire women with big ankles. While the original plan for the show was for Etting to do a tap dance after singing ""Shaking the Blues Away"", she later remembered she was not a very good dancer. At the show's final rehearsal, Flo Ziegfeld told her, ""Ruth, when you get through singing, just walk off the stage"". Etting also appeared in Ziegfeld's last ""Follies"" in 1931.  She went on to appear in a number of other hit shows in rapid succession, including Ziegfeld's Simple Simon and Whoopee!. Etting was not originally signed to perform in Simple Simon; she became part of the cast at the last minute when vocalist Lee Morse was too intoxicated to perform. Ziegfeld asked Etting to replace Morse; she hurried to Boston, where the show was being tried out prior to Broadway. When Etting arrived, songwriters Rodgers and Hart discovered that the song ""Ten Cents a Dance"" was not written for Etting's voice range. The three spent the night rewriting the song so Etting could perform it.  Toward the end of Simple Simon's Broadway run, Etting persuaded Ziegfeld to add ""Love Me Or Leave Me"" to the show though the song was originally written for Whoopee!. She had recorded the song in 1928, but Etting's new version of it was impressive enough to earn her a Vitaphone contract to make film shorts.  In Hollywood, Etting made a long series of movie shorts between 1929 and 1936, and three feature movies in 1933 and 1934. She described the short films as either having a simple plot to allow for her to sing two songs or with no plot at all. The idea was to have Etting sing at least two songs in the film. While she received a marquee billing for Roman Scandals, Etting had only two lines in the film and sang just one song. Etting believed she might have had more success in full-length films if she had been given some acting lessons. Her perception was that the studios viewed her only as a vocalist. She later recalled, ""I was no actress, and I knew it. But I could sell a song"". In 1936, she appeared in London in Ray Henderson's Transatlantic Rhythm. Etting quit the show because she and the other performers had not been paid.  Etting was first heard on radio station WLS when she was living in Chicago. Her appearance drew so much fan mail, the station signed her to a year's contract for twice weekly performances. She had her own twice weekly 15 minute radio show on CBS in the 1930s. By 1934, she was on NBC with sports announcer Ted Husing doing the announcing and Oldsmobile sponsoring her program.

Further inland was the Illyrian Paeonian Kingdom and the tribe of the Agrianes which covers most of the modern republic of Macedonia. Illyrians on the coast of the Adriatic were under the effects and influence of Hellenisation and some tribes adopted Greek, becoming bilingual due to their proximity to the Greek colonies in Illyria. Illyrians imported weapons and armor from the Ancient Greeks (such as the Illyrian type helmet, originally a Greek type) and also adopted the ornamentation of Ancient Macedon on their shields and their war belts (a single one has been found, dated 3rd century BC at modern Selce e Poshtme part of Macedon at the time under Philip V of Macedon).

Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, ""Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.""Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the BBC's Music Magazine.

Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

Thirty years into the future in 2074, time travel is invented, but is immediately outlawed.

The victims have bags over their heads, and silver bars strapped to their backs. This comes at a price: The severe sanctions on time travel mean that crime bosses eventually need to end a looper's contract, and also eliminate any traces of their working relationship, so they send his older version back to be killed by his younger self, referred to as ""closing the loop"", which each looper must do himself.

Gat men are so named for their magnum revolvers, which have greater range and accuracy than a looper's 'blunderbuss' shotgun; a weapon designed strictly for close quarters.While at the club one evening, another looper announces that he has just closed his loop.

The record opened at number one on the Billboard 200, making Jackson the first female artist in the Nielsen SoundScan era to do so.

Jackson took a larger role in songwriting and production than she did on her previous albums, explaining she found it necessary ""to write all the lyrics and half of the melodies"" while also speaking candidly about incorporating her sexuality into the album's content.

And when she announces her sexual maturity, as she does on her new album, Janet., it's a cultural moment.""In July 1993, Jackson made her film debut in Poetic Justice. While the film received mixed reviews, her performance was described as ""beguiling"" and ""believably eccentric.""

Introduction

As a book lover, I've always been fascinated by the stories of women throughout history. From the pioneers of science and medicine to the trailblazers of art and literature, women have left an indelible mark on society. And yet, despite their remarkable achievements, many of these women have unfortunately been overlooked in favor of the typical ""masculine"" expectations of their time.

GRPO,"Article:Simon Zebo and James Sherry tries saw Munster lead 14-6 but Niki Adeolokun's score and a penalty try helped Connacht move ahead 20-14 by the interval.
Adeolokun and Finlay Bealham added touchdowns after the break, while Shane O'Leary kicked a total of 15 points.
The result effectively ended Munster's hopes of a semi-final play-off place.
They are seventh in the table and face a battle to secure a berth in the Champions Cup next season.
Connacht, who leapfrogged Glasgow, completed a season double over their Irish interprovincial rivals for the first time, and a spot in the last four of the competition now appears certain.
Victory came as a boost to Pat Lam's men after Ulster ended their six-match unbeaten run in the competition, followed by a 33-32 defeat by Grenoble in the last eight of the European Challenge Cup.
A stray Munster hand in the ruck allowed O'Leary to put Connacht ahead after eight minutes, but Zebo - Munster's record try-scorer - went over on his 100th appearance.
Although O'Leary reduced the deficit to one point with a penalty, Munster's superb driving maul left Connacht scrambling backwards, and hooker Sherry touched down.
With Anthony Foley's side down to 14 men after James Cronin saw yellow, Connacht made their numerical advantage count.
The superb Bundee Aki burst through Munster's scrambled defensive line before moving the ball to Finlay Bealham, who sent Adeolokun racing under the posts. O'Leary's easy conversion brought Connacht within a point again.
Foley's men found themselves under severe pressure at the scrum and, when Billy Holland was sent to the sin-bin, Connacht made no mistake with a two-man advantage in the pack.
Referee Ben Whitehouse marched Munster under the posts for a penalty try that O'Leary converted for a six-point half-time lead.
When Robbie Henshaw dropped a cute kick in behind Munster, Adeolokun profited from an awkward bounce to touch down, although O'Leary missed the conversion.
Ultan Dillane's powerful carry put Connacht on the front foot deep in opposition territory and, when the ball was recycled, Bealham ran over.
O'Leary followed up the conversion with a penalty with the last kick of the game.
